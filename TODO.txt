* Maybe, have a Configurable interface with set/getConfiguration method
* which will get autowired with the matching class.
* or look at autowiring framework as a global addition.
* Or, have annotation @config that will take the type of the property
* it decorates, or accepts an optional configuration object as a value.
* Dagger 2 seems best: well-maintained, lightweight and compile-time

* Remove all "restrictTo" across the board in favor of XML flow (if/else, etc).
  At a minimum, if we keep it, wrap in "restrictions" to improve null handling.
  (e.g., blanking a default list)

* Add this https://www.mojohaus.org/versions/versions-maven-plugin/examples/display-plugin-updates.html

* Remove all @since prior V4 since the package change
  makes all classes "new" anyway?
  
* Remove all @author tags in favor of Git commit author?
  
* V3 to V4 config converter? or add a flag to support V3
  config as argument?
  
- Consider renaming (and deprecating) classes/methods with 
  acronyms/abbreviation to use camel-case.  
  E.g. XmlSomething as opposed to XMLSomething.
  That includes in Commons Lang
  
* For javadoc custom taglets, add a placeholder equivalent to <THIS_CLASS>
  that is replaced by the fully qualified name of the current class.
